                <p>The following devil sticks are available at a special discount for the entire month of May: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stick ($19.95)</strong> 
                    The easiest stick to learn with, but “grippy” enough for the most demanding tricks. Comes in red, green, and blue.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Flower Stick ($24.95)</strong>
                    A graceful stick with colored tassels. Flower Sticks fl oat slowly, making them ideal for beginners.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Master Stick ($39.95)</strong>
                    Our most popular stick is shorter and heavier for fast play and more advanced tricks. Each Master Stick is available in custom colors.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong></strong>
                    The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a fire stick).
                    </li>
                </ul>
